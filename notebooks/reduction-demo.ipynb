In this example, there's a small sample dataset of raw LDSS3C images stored in the directory `/Users/zkbt/Cosmos/Data/mosaurusexample/data/ut140809`. These data come from a transit observation of WASP-94Ab, and contain one of every expected filetype for LDSS3C."

We can also use it to set up some of the basics for how we should conduct the extraction for this instrument (how big of a subarray to think about for each target, parameters for extraction apertures, is it worth trying to zap cosmic rays?)."
